## CSP

A `CSP` is a `Cloud Service Provider`. The biggest ones are [AWS](/terms/Amazon-Aws), Azure, and GCP. 

Cloud Service Providers (CSP) are companies that offers computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software over the internet. Instead of relying on physical hardware in their own offices, organizations can rent these resources on demand and pay only for what they use. CSPs like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud make it possible to scale quickly, whether that means supporting millions of users or handling sudden spikes in demand. They also provide security, reliability, and global reach that most organizations could not easily achieve on their own. Cloud Service Providers are critical to todayâ€™s digital world because they power everyday services like streaming, online banking, e-commerce, and healthcare systems, forming the backbone of modern technology infrastructure.
