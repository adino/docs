## ICD9

`ICD-9` (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision) is a standardized system used to code and classify diagnoses and medical procedures. It was widely used in healthcare to organize patient information, bill insurance, and track public health data. Each disease, injury, or condition is assigned a numeric code for consistency across hospitals and providers. ICD-9 made it possible to share medical information accurately between systems and institutions. Although it has now been replaced by ICD-10, ICD-9 laid the foundation for modern medical coding.
