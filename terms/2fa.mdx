## Two Factor Authentication

`Two-factor authentication` (2FA) adds an additional layer of login security to Adino accounts by requiring users to provide two mechanisms of authentication instead of just one.

There are three mechanisms for authentication:

| Mechanism  | Meaning                     | Example                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Inherence  | Something the user _is_.    | Fingerprint, Facial recognition.             |
| Knowledge  | Something the user _knows_. | Adino password.                        |
| Possession | Something the user _has_.   | An authentication code from a mobile device. |
