## Back-End

The `backend` in technology refers to the server-side systems that power applications, handling data storage, business logic, and communication between the database and the user interface. It’s what makes apps and websites “work” behind the scenes, processing requests and delivering the right information. Technologies like servers, databases, and APIs are core to backend development. Every time you log into an app, stream a video, or make an online purchase, the backend is what ensures it all runs smoothly. Without it, the visible parts of technology (the frontend) would have nothing to connect to.
