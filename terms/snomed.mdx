## SNOMED

`SNOMED CT` (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms) is a comprehensive, standardized medical terminology system that describes diseases, symptoms, procedures, and other clinical details. It goes beyond billing codes by capturing rich, precise concepts for use in electronic health records. By providing a common language, SNOMED CT ensures that healthcare providers and systems interpret patient information consistently. This improves communication, patient care, research, and data exchange across organizations and countries. Today, it is one of the most widely used standards for interoperable health information worldwide.
