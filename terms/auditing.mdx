## Auditing
#### Medical Context (Healthcare Auditing)

`Auditing` in medicine refers to the systematic review and evaluation of clinical practices, patient records, or healthcare processes to ensure accuracy, quality of care, compliance with regulations, and patient safety.

Example: A hospital might audit medication orders to confirm they were administered correctly, or audit patient charts to check documentation completeness.

#### Software Development / IT Context (Auditing in Dev Lifecycle)

`Auditing` in software development refers to the process of tracking, reviewing, and verifying actions, code changes, system events, or user activities to ensure security, compliance, and accountability throughout the development lifecycle.

Example: An audit log may record who deployed code to production, when sensitive data was accessed, or whether dependencies passed a security scan.
