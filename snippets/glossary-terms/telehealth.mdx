## Telehealth
`Telehealth` is the use of digital communication tools—like video calls, secure messaging, and remote monitoring—to deliver healthcare services outside of traditional clinics or hospitals. It makes care more accessible by reaching patients in rural areas, those with limited mobility, or anyone who prefers the convenience of home-based visits. Telehealth also reduces costs, shortens wait times, and allows doctors to monitor chronic conditions in real time. With growing demand for efficiency, equity, and patient-centered care, telehealth is becoming a cornerstone of modern medicine. It represents the future of healthcare by making quality care faster, more flexible, and more widely available.
