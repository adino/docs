## Database

A `database` in technology is an organized collection of information that computers can easily access, manage, and update. It stores everything from customer records and financial transactions to app content and sensor data. Databases make it possible for apps, websites, and services to quickly retrieve and use the right information when you need it. They are essential for things like online shopping, banking, social media, and healthcare systems. Without databases, modern digital services would lose the ability to function reliably and efficiently.
