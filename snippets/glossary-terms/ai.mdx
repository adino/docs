## AI
`Artificial intelligence (AI)` is technology that enables computers and systems to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, or making decisions. It powers tools like chatbots, recommendation engines, self-driving cars, and medical diagnostics. By analyzing vast amounts of data, AI can solve problems faster and more accurately than people in many areas. Today, it is woven into daily life through smartphones, search engines, navigation apps, and more. AI is critical because it drives innovation, efficiency, and new possibilities across nearly every industry.
