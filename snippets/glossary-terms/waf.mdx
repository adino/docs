### WAF

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security system that helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet.

A `WAF` can be placed in front of Web Servers and protects Web Applications against common web exploits and bots that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.
